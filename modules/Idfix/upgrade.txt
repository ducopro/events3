This little document describes which properties should be adapted when upgrading from asterix to Idfix

-iconlib=bootstrap
-iconlib=http://cdn.dustball.com/
Asterix shipped with a standard iconlib. This is now deprecated.
Use the bootstrap glyphicons or the icons from the dustball cdn.
This way no files need to be loaded from your server.
bootstrap is the default iconlib and virtual columns use these icons by default

-icon=flag
When you want to use glyphicon glyphicon-flag
@see http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons
Use bootstrap icons this way. 

-icon=flag_blue.png
@see http://www.dustball.com/icons/
uses http://cdn.dustball.com/flag_blue.png

-type=virtual
Columns in asterix were specified using virtual=1
This is deprecated. Use type=virtual instead.

NEW -href=
OLD -action=
On virtual columns the action attribute defined a url, that's now standardized to href.
